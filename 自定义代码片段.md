#### 组件描述

```
{
  // Place your snippets for vue here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Print to console": {
    "prefix": "vannotation",
    "body": [
      "$BLOCK_COMMENT_START",
      " <!--${1:组件名称}",
      "     /**",
      "     * @desc ${2:组件描述}",
      "     * @author  唐游超",
      "     * @date $CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND",
      "     * @params: ${3:重要参数说明1}",
      "     * other: ${4:其他说明}",
      "         */",
      "     -->"
    ],
    "description": "The component annotation"
  }
}
